This is a project of building and training a custom NER model on publicly available ATIS flight dataset. Here I have experimented with several machine learning models and finally got highest accuracy of 93% with Conditional Random Fields(CRF). Though the classes with high frequency are performing very well, the classes with low frequency are also performing considerable well. Due to data imbalance and scarcity I decided to go with machine learning models, as machine learning models perform well even with less data and low resource. Deep learning based approaches could be tried to predict low frequency classes well, but in that case much more data will be required to mitigate the issue of data imbalance. To mitigate the problem of data imbalance various text data augmentation techniques like random insertion, random deletion, random swapping and others could be used.
